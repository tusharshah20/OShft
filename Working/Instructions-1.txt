==========================
Local OpenShift Origin (OKD 3.x) Cluster on CentOS 7
--Docker installed
--Docker daemon is configured with an insecure registry parameter of 172.30.0.0/16
--ipv4 forwarding enabled
--firewall allows containers access to openshift master API(8443/tcp) and DNS(53/udp) endpoints (in our case firewalld has been stopped)
#login as root
$sudo su
cd openshi<tab>
./oc version

#to start OpenShift Origin (OKD) Local cluster
./oc cluster up
The command above will:

Start OKD Cluster listening on the local interface â€“ 127.0.0.1:8443
Start a web console listening on all interfaces at /console (127.0.0.1:8443).
Launch Kubernetes system components.
Provisions registry, router, initial templates, and a default project.
The OpenShift cluster will run as an all-in-one container on a Docker host.

./oc cluster status

./oc login -u system:admin



Thus cluster should be running and applications can be deployed...
