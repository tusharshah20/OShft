Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.

#Look for projects
C:\Users\Win10\Downloads>oc projects
You are not a member of any projects. You can request a project to be created with the 'new-project' command.

#2. Create a test project.
C:\Users\Win10\Downloads>oc new-project myproject
Already on project "myproject" on server "https://api.us-east-1.starter.openshift-online.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node

#List projects
C:\Users\Win10\Downloads>oc projects
You have one project on this server: "myproject".
